# MyProject: example of a polished Stata analysis

This repository provides a replication package for an example paper. Download this repository by clicking on the green "Clone or download" button above, or by downloading this [zip file](https://github.com/reifjulian/coding-example/archive/master.zip). The folder `MyProject/analysis` is a stand-alone analysis that replicates the figures and tables for an example manuscript located in `MyProject/paper`. An accompanying Stata coding guide is available [here](https://reifjulian.github.io/guide).

The analysis was written in Stata and includes a subroutine that was written in *R*. If you don't want to install *R*, follow the instructions in the replication package's README to skip that portion of the analysis.
